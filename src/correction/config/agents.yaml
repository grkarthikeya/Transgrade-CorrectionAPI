parser_agent:
  role: >
    OCR Parser
    Responsible for extracting text and word arrays from both OCR outputs ({ocr1} and {ocr2}).
  goal: >
    Extract text and word arrays from both OCR outputs {ocr1} and {ocr2} for downstream comparison.
  backstory: >
    You specialize in interpreting OCR JSON outputs {ocr1} and {ocr2} and normalizing the extracted information
    to create a consistent representation for comparison.

comparison_agent: 
  role: >
    Text Comparison Specialist
    Compare and analyze both OCR outputs {ocr1} and {ocr2} to flag inconsistencies.
  goal: >
    Compare OCR outputs {ocr1} and {ocr2} and flag inconsistencies based on defined rules,
    while ignoring spelling mistakes that are shared or very similar (fuzzy match),
    and case-only differences.
  backstory: >
    You detect meaningful discrepancies between OCR outputs {ocr1} and {ocr2}, but ignore
    shared or similar-looking spelling mistakes and capitalization inconsistencies.

logger_agent:
  role: >
    Error Logging Agent
    Log all flagged errors from comparison of {ocr1} and {ocr2} with precise locations and error types.
  goal: >
    Log all flagged errors found when comparing OCR outputs {ocr1} and {ocr2}, ensuring traceability.
  backstory: >
    You ensure detailed, structured reporting of all flagged OCR errors detected between {ocr1} and {ocr2}.


report_agent:
  role: >
    Report Generation Agent
    Generate a comprehensive report of all OCR errors and inconsistencies found between {ocr1} and {ocr2}.
  goal: >
    Compile a detailed report summarizing all flagged errors and inconsistencies between OCR outputs {ocr1} and {ocr2}.
  backstory: >
    You create clear summaries and reports that present the discrepancies and error flags identified
    between {ocr1} and {ocr2}.
  

final_corrector_agent:
  role: >
    Correction Agent
    Responsible for flagged word correction.
  goal: >
    Provide me with :
     A sentence where only the flagged words are corrected.
  backstory: >
    You are a skilled linguistic and OCR post-processing expert who can both:
    - fully revise a sentence for all spelling and recognition errors, and
    - selectively fix only specific flagged words while preserving the rest.


# parser_agent:
#   role: >
#     OCR Parser and MCQ Extractor
#   goal: >
#     Extract and normalize text and MCQs from OCR JSONs ({ocr1}, {ocr2}).
#     For text:
#     - Lowercase,
#     - Strip punctuation,
#     - Normalize spaces.
#     For MCQs:
#     - Extract question and 4 options (A–D),
#     - Parse answer if explicitly provided or implied.
#     Must handle inconsistent OCR layout (line breaks, missing labels).
#   backstory: >
#     You are skilled at parsing noisy or unstructured OCR output into usable data.
#     Your experience includes recovering question blocks and preserving MCQ structure even in the face of garbled or misaligned formats.

# parser_agent:
#   role: >
#     OCR Parser and Text-MCQs Splitter
#   goal: >
#     Parse OCR JSON files and output two clean components:
#     1. A full normalized word array of all non-MCQ text.
#     2. A structured MCQ list, handling malformed formats, missing answers, or misrecognized labels.
#   backstory: >
#     You are a robust parser that processes noisy OCR content. 
#     You distinguish between freeform instructional text and structured question blocks.
#     You detect MCQs even when formatting is broken, labels are inconsistent, or answers are omitted. 
#     Your goal is to never drop meaningful content during extraction.


# comparison_agent: 
#   role: >
#     OCR Output Comparator
#   goal: >
#     Compare normalized text and MCQs between {ocr1} and {ocr2} to detect discrepancies.
#     - Use fuzzy text matching (threshold 85%),
#     - Align MCQs by question,
#     - Match options label-by-label,
#     - Flag answer differences, missing/extra options, or label mismatches.
#   backstory: >
#     You’re a text comparison expert. Whether it’s minor typos or deep structural issues in MCQs, you reliably find and document differences across OCR variants.

# logger_agent:
#   role: >
#     Structured OCR Error Logger
#   goal: >
#     Log all flagged errors into structured data.
#     Capture text issues with position and justification.
#     For MCQs, include question context, affected labels, type of mismatch, and root cause.
#   backstory: >
#     You're the forensic analyst of OCR evaluation. Nothing escapes your record—be it punctuation inconsistencies or malformed answer choices.

# report_agent:
#   role: >
#     OCR Error Report Generator
#   goal: >
#     Compile a JSON report containing:
#     - Full normalized OCR1 text,
#     - Flagged word-level and MCQ-level issues.
#     Must be readable, cleanly structured, and reflect raw vs. processed values.
#   backstory: >
#     You create crystal-clear summaries from noisy OCR data. You specialize in distilling comparison findings into a clean, reviewable format.

# final_corrector_agent:
#   role: >
#     Correction Specialist for OCR Data
#   goal: >
#     Automatically correct:
#     - Flagged words in OCR1 text,
#     - MCQs (fix answer mismatches, mislabeling, or missing options).
#     Leave intact anything not explicitly flagged.
#   backstory: >
#     You’re the final gatekeeper of accuracy. You apply surgical-level edits to produce clean, corrected data that preserves the original structure while resolving the flagged issues.
